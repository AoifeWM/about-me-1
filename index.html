      <p>
        My name is Erich Hartnauer. I am a 32 year old father of three. I have a
        high school diploma with college experience. I prefer to learn
        autodidactically in most cases. I am currently attending Code Fellows in
        the hopes of landing a job in tech with the ultimate goal of working
        remote so I can be around my wife and kids more often. I am currently
        working as a plant operator for Airgas producing beverage grade carbon
        dioxide for multiple beverage customers locally and out of state. Prior
        to this current job I served five years in the Marine Corps in a similar
        field that I am currently working in. My long-term goals are to get a
        job as a developer, learn Tagalog, and read more.
